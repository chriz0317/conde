# MMG Autozone (Website)

This repository contains the Laravel-based website for MMG Autozone.

Conflict resolution
- The README previously contained merge conflict markers or was empty — this file was recreated with a short project summary to resolve the conflict.

Quick start
- Serve the app locally (using XAMPP): place the project under your web root and visit `http://localhost/website/website/public/`.

Files of interest
- `resources/views/landing.blade.php` — landing/hero content
- `resources/views/products.blade.php` — services header and product listing
- `resources/css/app.css` — primary site styles

If you want a different README body or to preserve specific previous content, tell me what to include and I'll update it.
